					<h1> Welcome to The Garden Shop ‚Äì Growing Together Since 1962 </h1>

				<div class="col-12 col-sm-8 col-lg-8 text-center">
					<p> The Garden Shop is a family run business established in 1962, by the current owners‚Äô grand aunt, Miss Sheila Harvey. She was a knowledgeable lady who trained in horticulture. Many people still remember her fondly. Now in the 21st Century, her grand nephew‚Äôs Justin and Paul Harvey, are continuing on the business in her legacy.</p>
					<p>The restocked and relaunched garden centre is a gardener‚Äôs delight and a cornerstone in the community. A truly unique place with a quirky feel and showstopping displays where all, old and young, are welcome to play, share, learn and shop.</p>
					<p>Although plants are no longer grown on site, we work with the best nurseries on the island to offer the very best of Irish grown plants to our customers. Meet our expert staff to guide you through the extensive range of plants, pots and all things garden. We are here to help you create your very own dream outdoor space.</p>
					<p>The Garden Shop can also boast of an impressive range of barbecues, offering only the best brands: Weber, Traeger, Kamado Joe, and Ooni. Meet our experts to get all the tips and tricks to make the most of your grill. Looking for ideas? We organise demonstrations and classes too.</p>

				<h2>What people say about us:</h2>
				<p>‚ÄòWell worth a visit. Creative displays and wide varieties of almost any garden accessory.‚Äô</p>
				<p>(Mary Falconer)</p>
				<br>
				<p>Have not managed to visit this garden centre yet but did buy a beautiful Hydrangea online. I needed it by a certain day to give as a gift and received a phone call from Ben to assure me it would happen. I then got another call to say it would arrive the next day. I'm so impressed by the service and the plant is stunning! 5 stars for quality and service. Thanks so much The Garden Shop!</p>
				<p>(Cathy Wyse)</p>
				<br>
				<p>If you like gardening you are gonna love this place. It's the best of the best, the staff are so nice and ready to educate you about all things that you need to grow an amazing garden. The choices of plants, shrubs and trees...not to mention pots, fertiliser, compost, fences and accessories. You would spend a couple of hours easy rambling around.</p>
				<p>Well done The Garden Shop üëèüèº</p>
				<p >(Sinead D.)</p>
				<br>
				<p>My absolutely favourite garden centre. Very knowledgeable staff, plants are in great condition and very well cared for and the prices are excellent. I am here nearly every week (even if it is just for a walk around)</p>
